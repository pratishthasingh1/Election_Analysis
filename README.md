Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
This script can be used to determine the winner of each county and to see which county is most active in terms of vote turnout. Knowing this can help campaigns to determine which counties can be visited to increase turnout/gain voter confidence. 

I would modify this by adding age of the voters into the script. Age is a big factor in determining voter turnout rates. Diana DeGette has almost two times the amount of votes to her runner-up and even more compared to her second runner-up. This makes me want to understand how she was so successful -- one of the determining factor may be age. Age can answer multiple questions: was there a higher count for Diana DeGette because she appealed to a certain age group, who also happened to be the age group that votes more? Or did she appeal more to all age groups overall than compared to her opponents? 
I would also want to look into income brackets. Which income bracket is voting, and which are they voting for?
Both of these modifications can be used to analyze elections of all kinds -- given they are following plurality rule.
